- ✅ Multiple GNN models (CODEN, TIP-GNN, RGP, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple evaluation frameworks (DeepTRACE, CiteGuard, Judge Framework, etc.)
- ✅ MCP gateway with RBAC/ABAC
- ✅ Prompt registry with versioning
- ✅ Model registry for governance
- ✅ Citation quality rules

**Gaps**: ✅ **ALL RESOLVED**
- ✅ Intelligent model routing implemented (`lib/ai/router.ts`)
- ✅ Automatic fallbacks with circuit breakers implemented

- ✅ Citation faithfulness regression budgets implemented (`lib/evaluation/citation-metrics.ts`)

### Phase 1: Model Router (Priority: High) ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Goal**: Per-task routing using latency/cost/quality constraints with automatic fallbacks.

**Implementation**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
1. **Task-Based Routing** (`lib/ai/router.ts`): ✅
   - Extract/cluster tasks → Fast, cost-effective models (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3-haiku)
   - Judge/eval tasks → High-quality models (GPT-4o, Claude-3-opus)
   - Generate tasks → Balanced models (GPT-4o, Claude-3-sonnet)
   - Summarize tasks → Fast models (GPT-4o-mini)

2. **Routing Logic**: ✅
   - Latency constraints (p95 < 2s for extract, < 5s for generate)
   - Cost constraints (budget per tenant)
   - Quality constraints (citation faithfulness > 0.9 for generate)
   - Automatic fallback chain (primary → secondary → tertiary)

3. **Circuit Breakers**: ✅
   - Provider health monitoring (`lib/ai/provider-health.ts`)
   - Automatic failover on errors
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Idempotency keys for retries

4. **Cost Tracking**: ✅
   - Per-tenant cost limits (`lib/ai/cost-tracker.ts`)
